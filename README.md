## Getting started

### Project structure

Inside Systic template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ robots.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ styles/
|   |       â””â”€â”€ base.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ items/
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ item-slug-1.md
|   |       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ widgets/
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Header.astro
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.astro
|   |       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ BaseLayout.astro
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ [item]/
|   |   |   â””â”€â”€ [slug].astro
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ 404.astro
|   |   â””-- rss.xml.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.
